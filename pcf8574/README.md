### Sample usage

```java
import nz.geek.android.things.driver.pcf8574.Pcf8574;

// Access IO port:

Pcf8574 pcf8574;

// create a port with an address (the value of A0-A2), an I2C bus name,
// and a flag to indicate that the port type is a PCF8574 as opposed to
// a PCF8574A (which has a different base address)

pcf8574 = Pcf8574.create(pcf8574Address, i2cBusName, isPcf8574);

// Write to port, the first argument is a bitmask, the second is
// the data to write. Data does not affect port pins where mask bit is 1

pcf8574.writeByte(0x00, 0x00);

// Close the port when finished:

try {
    pcf8574.close();
} catch (IOException e) {
    // error closing IO port
}
```
