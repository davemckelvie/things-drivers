==========================================

![Maven Central](https://img.shields.io/maven-central/v/nz.geek.android/things-driver-pca9685)

Android Things driver for the [pca9685](https://www.nxp.com/docs/en/data-sheet/PCA9685.pdf) 16 channel, 12 bit PWM controller

How to use the driver
---------------------

### Gradle dependency

To use the `pca9685` driver, add the line below to your project's `build.gradle`.

```
dependencies {
    implementation 'nz.geek.android.things:things-driver-pca9685:<version>'
}
```

### Hardware hookup

![Raspberry Pi Hookup](rpi3_pca9685.png)

### Sample usage

```java
import nz.geek.android.things.driver.pca9685.Pca9685;

// Access PWM controller:
Pca9685 pca9685;

// create a PWM with an address (the value of A0-A5) and an I2C bus name
Pca9685 = pca9685.create(Pca9685Address, i2cBusName);

// Set the PWM frequency of the device. This can only be set on the device level,
// not individual pins, it is set to the last set value for any of the 16 pins.
// the minimum according to the data sheet is 24 Hz and the maximum is 1526 Hz.
pca9685.setPwmFrequencyHz(50);

// Set individual pin duty cycles, the pins are numbered 0 to 15, duty cycle
// is 0 to 100 (percent)
pca9685.setPwmDutyCycle(dutyCycle, pinNumber);

// Close the PWM controller when finished:
try {
    pca9685.close();
} catch (IOException e) {
    // error closing PWM controller
}
```
